		<h1 class="title-color">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
		                        in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h1>
		<p class="p-color">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
		                   transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
		                   for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
		                   The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
		                   the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

		<h1 class="title-color">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from
		                        them and
		                        learning from their experiences was easy.</h1>
		<p class="p-color">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The
		                   program
		                   gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a
		                   capable
		                   junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need
		                   from
		                   an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>

		<h1 class="title-w">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h1>
		<p class="p-w">
			“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
			professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
			student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
			did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
			project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
			could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
			experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
			100% recommend! ”
